%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of 
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that 
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should 
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at 
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[twocolumn]{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts 
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to

%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.

\title{Reviving stochasticity: SMBH-binary eccentricity is inherently random}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are believed to reside at the centres of almost all massive galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{kormendy2013}. 
As galaxies dynamically interact, so too are their SMBHs expected to interact in a three-phase merger process \citep{begelman1980}.
The first phase, dynamical friction \citep{chandrasekhar1943}, acts to bring the SMBHs from kiloparsec-scale separations to parsec-scale separations, after which the SMBHs form a bound binary system with a semimajor axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$.
Following the binding of the SMBHs, the SMBH binary separation is reduced through sequential slingshot encounters with the surrounding stellar distribution \citep{hills1980, hills1983, quinlan1996}.
Chaotic interactions drive the SMBH binary to sub-parsec separation: a regime where gravitational wave (GW) emission becomes the dominant mechanism by which the SMBH binary can lose its remaining orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the coalescence of the two SMBHs into a single SMBH.

It is well known that the efficiency by which GW emission can remove orbital energy and angular momentum from a binary system is highly sensitive to the binary eccentricity \citep{peters1964}, with the binary merger timescale being particularly sensitive. 
The complex nature of SMBH coalescence in a galaxy merger setting necessitates the use of numerical techniques to understand, and to provide quantitative predictions for observational programmes such as pulsar timing arrays \citep[PTAs, e.g.][]{babak2016,falxa2023} and the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna \citep[LISA, e.g.][]{amaro-seoane2007} mission.
Understanding how faithfully SMBH binary eccentricity is captured in simulations is thus a critical piece of the puzzle in constraining the SMBH merger rate that the observational GW community aims to detect. 

Previous work by \citet{nasim2020} have argued that scatter in SMBH binary eccentricity observed in gas-free merger simulations is an artefact of poor phase space discretisation, and that in the real Universe where SMBH masses are far greater than stellar masses, $M_\bullet \gg m_\star$, SMBH binary eccentricity is a reliably predictable quantity.
In this work, we find that SMBH binary eccentricity is reliably predictable only for particular initial conditions of the galaxy merger system, and does not in general hold.
Indeed, we find that for realistic galaxy merger orbits where the initial orbital eccentricity of the system is $e_0>0.90$, stochasticity in the final SMBH binary eccentricity is present.

    The downwards-pointing arrows indicate the median time when the SMBH binaries becomes hard for the two simulation sets. 
    In both the shown $e_0 = 0.90$ and $e_0 = 0.99$ sets, one simulation has a comparatively low eccentricity, displacing it to a value of $e$ greater than $2.5\sigma$ from the collective mean. 
    In the $e_0=0.90$ set, seven simulations have a SMBH binary merger within $50\,\mathrm{Myr}$, as indicated by the rapid circularisation of the eccentricity.}
    \label{fig:eccentricities}
\end{figure*}

We construct a number of idealised galaxy merger simulations, which we evolve with our new version of \ketju{} \citep{rantala2017, rantala2020,mannerkoski2023}, implemented in \gadget{} \citep{springel2021}.
For details about the implementation of \ketju{}, we point the reader to \citet{mannerkoski2023}.

We construct our galaxy models to represent the nuclear bulge of a gas-devoid elliptical galaxy, matching those models of \citet{nasim2020}.
Each galaxy is thus represented as a stellar-only Dehnen sphere \citep{dehnen1993} with shape parameter $\gamma=0.5$ and scale radius $a=186\,\mathrm{pc}$, where the Dehnen profile is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dehnen}
    \rho_\star(r) = \frac{(3-\gamma)M_\star}{4\pi} \frac{a}{r^\gamma (r+a)^{(4-\gamma)}}.
\end{equation}
The total stellar mass is $M_\star=10^{10}\,\Msun$, and at the centre of the model galaxy a SMBH of mass $M_\bullet=10^8\,\Msun$ is placed with zero initial velocity.
We test five different mass resolutions by sampling the stellar phase space distribution with a varying number of stellar particles: $N_\star = \{2.5\times10^5, 5.0\times10^5, 1.0\times10^6, 2.0\times10^6, 4.0\times10^6\}$.

We then construct isolated merger initial conditions by placing two galaxies on an elliptical orbit with varying values of eccentricity, at a fixed initial separation of $D=3.72\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and semimajor axis $a_0=2.79\,\mathrm{kpc}$.
The chosen eccentricities $e_0$ are 0.90 and 0.99.
We ensure that the radial and tangential velocities of the initial merger setup are consistent with the values reported in \citet{gualandris2022}.
For each orbital configuration, we run ten realisations for each mass resolution, to account for Brownian motion effects of the SMBH binary caused by the discretised phase space.

    The expected $1/\sqrt{N_\star}$ scaling is recovered for the $e_0 = 0.90$ suite after applying a $2.5\sigma$-cut to the simulation data. 
    For the $e_0=0.99$ suite, a steeper scaling than the $1/\sqrt{N_\star}$ is obtained after applying a similar $2.5\sigma$-cut to the data.}

\subsection{\drafting{Eccentricity scatter in simulations}}

The SMBH binary eccentricity for both the $e_0=0.90$ (blue) and $e_0=0.99$ (orange) orbits are shown in \autoref{fig:eccentricities} as a function of shifted time $t' = t - t_\mathrm{bound}$ for the highest mass resolution sets. 
At least one simulation is seen to lie significantly beyond the mean eccentricity in each set, with $e_\mathrm{h} \sim 0.8$ for the $e_0=0.90$ set and $e_\mathrm{h}\sim 0.2$ for the $e_0=0.99$ set. 
The median time when each simulation set forms a hard binary is similar between the two sets, as indicated by the arrows in \autoref{fig:eccentricities}.
The $e_0=0.90$ set also demonstrates seven SMBH-binary mergers within $50\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of forming a bound binary, seen as a rapid circularisation in eccentricity in \autoref{fig:eccentricities}, which is captured self-consistently using \ketju{}.

To characterise the scatter in eccentricity, we determine the mean eccentricity $e_\mathrm{h}$ over five orbital periods centred on the orbit within which the SMBH binary has become hard.
The binary hardening radius $a_\mathrm{h}$ is defined as \citep[e.g.][]{merritt2006}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ahard}
    a_\mathrm{h} = \frac{q}{(1+q)^2} \frac{r_\mathrm{m}}{4} = \frac{r_\mathrm{m}}{16},
\end{equation}
where $r_\mathrm{m}=r(m<2M_{\bullet,1})$ is the influence radius and $q$ is the mass ratio between the SMBHs (for our simulations $q=1.0$, giving rise to the second equality in \autoref{eq:ahard}).
Assuming the distribution of mean hard-binary eccentricities is Gaussian, we characterise the inter-simulation eccentricity scatter as the standard deviation in mean values of $e_\mathrm{h}$, denoted as $\sigma_e$.

We show the dependence of inter-simulation eccentricity standard deviation on mass resolution for the $e_0=0.90$ orbit in \autoref{fig:convergence} with circle markers, and for the $e_0=0.99$ orbit using square markers.
The full set of ten simulations per mass resolution is shown with unfilled markers, and those simulations satisfying a $2.5\sigma$-cut in eccentricity with filled markers. 

For the $e_0=0.90$ orbit, using the full set of simulations results in a lack of convergence of $\sigma_e$, with $5\times10^3$ and $1\times10^4$ mass resolutions demonstrating an increased scatter compared to the lowest mass resolution of $2.5\times10^3$.
The peculiar values of $\sigma_e$ arise due to the assumed Gaussian distribution of the eccentricity between simulations.
Inspecting the orbital parameters for all simulations from the $e_0=0.90$ set, it is found that for resolutions of $5\times10^3$ and $1\times10^4$ the eccentricity clusters around a value of $e_\mathrm{h}\simeq0.90$, except for one simulation at both $5\times10^3$ and $1\times10^4$ resolutions which has a value of $e_\mathrm{h}<0.4$.
This one outlier for each of the two resolutions artificially inflates the measured eccentricity variance, and with the $2.5\sigma$-cut data we recover the $1/\sqrt{N_\star}$ scaling of $\sigma_e$, confirming the results of \citet{nasim2020}, apart from the highest mass resolution set of $M_\bullet/m_\star=4\times10^4$.
The variation in eccentricity also clearly decreases for the cleaned $e_0=0.99$ orbit simulations, albeit with a steeper gradient than the $e_0=0.90$ set. 
Again, a single simulation at the highest mass resolution for the $e_0=0.99$ set is responsible for the inflated value of $\sigma_e$ in the full data set for this resolution.

Critically, the eccentricity values beyond $2.5\sigma$ from the mean that are removed in our cleaned samples are each still a valid measurement from the simulation, and highlight the presence of stochasticity in eccentricity for these idealised simulation set-ups with a highly-radial initial orbit. 
The cause of these low eccentricity values is discussed in \autoref{ssec:toy}.

\subsection{Binary binding process and the scatter in eccentricity}

To understand the observed scatter in eccentricity, we investigate the binary binding process in each simulation. 
Whilst the two SMBHs are unbound, they undergo a number of hyperbolic orbits influenced by the galactic merger potential.
At each pericentre passage, the two SMBHs scatter off each other with some deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$, defined:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theta}
    \theta_\mathrm{defl} = 2 \arctan \left(\frac{GM}{L\sqrt{2E}} \right)
\end{equation}
where $M=M_{\bullet,1}+M_{\bullet,2}$, and $L$ is the magnitude of the SMBH 
binary angular momentum vector and $E$ the binary orbital energy at the time of the pericentre passage \citep{binney2008}.
The deflection angle is a function of the impact parameter $b$ of the SMBH trajectory, however is able to be more robustly measured than $b$ from the simulation data.
We set as the first deflection angle the first 
angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ that exceeds an orbit-dependent threshold:
$\theta_{\mathrm{defl,min}}=90\degr$ for the $e_0=0.99$ suite and $\theta_{\mathrm{defl,min}}=45\degr$ for the $e_0=0.90$ suite.
In general, this corresponds to the second or third actual pericentre passage of the SMBHs in the simulations.
An example of $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ is shown for two realisations of the $e_0=0.90$ ($e_0=0.99$) orbit in the left (right) panel of \autoref{fig:orbit}, which occurs between the points A and B in the SMBH binary orbit in each inset panel. 
We observe evidence for a relationship between the deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ and the resulting eccentricity at the time the SMBH binary becomes hard, which we explain using a simple toy model.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{orbit}
    \caption{Orbits from $t=0\,\mathrm{Myr}$ to a time shortly after $t_\mathrm{bound}$ of a single SMBH in two representative realisations of the $e_0=0.90$ mergers (left) and the $e_0=0.99$ mergers (right), which by symmetry of the equal mass system is a reflection of the second BH orbit about the $x=-z$ line. 
    Each line is coloured according to the shifted time $t'=t-t_\mathrm{bound}$ of the simulation, however the colours for $|t'|>2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ is constant for visual clarity of the deflection-phase of the evolution. 
    In each inset panel, point A shows a time just before the first hard scattering $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$, and point B a time just after. 
    The circle marker indicates the position of the SMBH just before the SMBHs form a bound binary.}

To gain insight into the origin of the dependence of binary eccentricity on the 
deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ during the binary formation,
we have constructed a simple toy model that can qualitatively reproduce the observed
behavior from the simulations.
This model includes only the essential components relevant to this process,
which are the asymmetric background stellar potential,
dynamical friction from the stellar background,
and naturally the SMBHs themselves.

For simplicity, we consider only symmetrical 1:1 mergers, and take the BH orbits
to lie in the $xy$-plane.
In this case the relative motion of the BHs can be treated as a one-body problem,
with the equation of motion
\begin{equation} \label{eq:toy_model_eom}
\ddot{\vb{x}} = -\frac{2 G M_\bullet}{|\vb{x}|^3} \vb{x} + \vb{a}_\mathrm{bg} + \vb{a}_\mathrm{DF},
\end{equation}
where $\vb{x}=(x,y)$ is the separation vector of the BHs, $M_\bullet$ the mass of a single BH,
$\vb{a}_\mathrm{bg}$ the acceleration due to the background potential,
and $\vb{a}_\mathrm{DF}$ the acceleration due to dynamical friction.

The background galaxy is modeled as a constant density spheroidal potential,
causing the acceleration \citep[e.g.][]{binney2008}
\begin{equation}
\vb{a}_\mathrm{bg} = - 2 \pi G \rho \operatorname{diag}(A_x,A_y) \vb{x},
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the stellar density,
and the $A$ coefficients are related to the eccentricity $e_\mathrm{s}$ of the spheroid as
\begin{align}
A_x &= 2 \frac{1-e_\mathrm{s}^2}{e_\mathrm{s}^2} 
    \left[\frac{1}{2 e_\mathrm{s}} \ln\left(\frac{1+e_\mathrm{s}}{1-e_\mathrm{s}}\right) - 1 \right]\\
A_y &= \frac{1-e_\mathrm{s}^2}{e_\mathrm{s}^2} 
        \left[ \frac{1}{1-e_\mathrm{s}^2} 
        - \frac{1}{2 e_\mathrm{s}} \ln\left(\frac{1+e_\mathrm{s}}{1-e_\mathrm{s}}\right)\right].
\end{align}
Here we have chosen the long axis of the spheroid to be aligned with the $x$-axis.
With eccentricity values of $e_\mathrm{s} \approx 0.9$,
this spheroidal potential matches the central potential in the galaxy during the
SMBH binary binding phase reasonably well,
apart from the contributions from the BHs themselves and the groups of stars bound to them.

For dynamical friction, we use the \citet{chandrasekhar1943} formula assuming
a Maxwellian distribution with a constant velocity dispersion $\sigma_\mathrm{M}$ \citep[e.g.][]{binney2008}.
This formula gives the acceleration of a single BH due to dynamical friction as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chandra_df}
\begin{aligned}
\vb{a}_{1,\mathrm{DF}} = &-\frac{4 \pi G^2 M_\bullet \rho \ln{\Lambda}}{|\vb{v}_{1}|^3}\\
                        &\times\left(\operatorname{erf}(X) - \frac{2X}{\sqrt{\pi}} \exp(-X^2)\right)\vb{v}_{1},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vb{v}_1 = \dot{\vb{x}}/2$ is the velocity of a single BH,
$X = |\vb{v}_1|/\sqrt{2}\sigma_\mathrm{M}$,
and the Coulomb logarithm is taken to have the value $\ln{\Lambda} = 10$.
To account for differences between the constant density background of stars
assumed here and the more complex system that is present in the simulations
we additionally multiply the acceleration given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:chandra_df}
with a scaling and cut-off function
\begin{equation}
f(a) = \frac{\alpha}{1 + \exp[(a_\mathrm{c}-a)/d_\mathrm{c}]},
\end{equation}
which serves to remove the effect of dynamical friction when the SMBH binary has become
hard in addition to allowing the strength of dynamical friction to be scaled to
achieve similar behavior as observed in the simulations, since in the simulations the
stellar background is much more complex.
Here $a$ is the semi-major axis of a bound binary, and for unbound binaries we set $f(a)=\alpha$.
We set the scaling factor $\alpha=0.5$, and use cut-off scales $a_\mathrm{c}=2 a_\mathrm{h}$
and $d_\mathrm{c} = 0.5 a_\mathrm{h}$,
with $a_\mathrm{h}$ being the semimajor-axis of a hard BH binary.
The total dynamical friction term is then
\begin{equation}
\vb{a}_{\mathrm{DF}} = 2 f(a) \vb{a}_{1,\mathrm{DF}}.
\end{equation}

To mimic the nearly linearly plunging orbit in the high-eccentricity merger orbit simulations,
we specify the initial conditions confined to the $xy$-plane as 
\begin{align}
\vb{x}_0 &= (r_0, b)\\
\dot{\vb{x}}_0 &= (-v_0, 0).
\end{align}
We fix $r_0 = 25\,\mathrm{pc}$,
and use model parameters
$\rho = 300 \,\Msun\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$,
$\sigma_\mathrm{M}=200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$,
and
$M_\bullet=10^8\,\Msun$,
which are fairly similar to the central properties of the merging galaxy when
the SMBHs are becoming bound in the $e_0=0.90$ and $e_0=0.99$ merger orbit simulations.
Based on the simulations we set $v_0 = 450\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to match the $e_0=0.90$ case,
and $v_0 = 560\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to match the $e_0=0.99$ case.
The spheroid eccentricity parameter is not easily measurable from the simulations,
and we therefore perform calculations with different values of $e_\mathrm{s}$.
We compute the resulting eccentricities for a range of impact parameters up to $b=20\,\mathrm{pc}$
for the two initial velocities,
by solving the equation of motion \eqref{eq:toy_model_eom} until the binary has become hard using
the error controlled 8th order Runge--Kutta method DOP853 included in the SciPy library \citep{virtanen2020}.
The range of impact parameters covers most of the relevant parameter space,
as a $90\degr$ deflection during the first pericenter passage
corresponds to initial impact parameters of $b\approx 5.8\,\mathrm{pc}$ and
$b\approx 3.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ for the $e_0=0.90$ and $e_0=0.99$ cases, respectively.

The resulting model curves are shown together with the simulation data in \autoref{fig:theta_e}.
We observe a modest decrease in deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ with increasing mass resolution for both the $e_0=0.90$ and $e_0=0.99$ cases. 
To correctly match the data in the $e_0=0.90$ case, the model curve has been shifted to the left by $12\degr$,
while in the $e_0=0.99$ case a smaller shift of $6\degr$ is used.
Otherwise the model appears to give a very good match to the simulation results,
and the required slight shift could be due to the galactic potential being slightly tilted in the simulations 
compared to the BH trajectories due to the complex dynamics at this stage.
In the $e_0=0.99$ case we can also see that the simulation data has significant scatter around
the model curve in the $\theta_\mathrm{defl} \gtrsim 120\degr$ region,
although the model does appear to capture the mean behavior fairly well.
The behavior of the model in this region is also quite sensitive to the exact value of $e_\mathrm{s}$,
which might be related to the large scatter in the simulation data.

Overall we can however see that this simple model correctly captures the behavior of eccentricity seen in the simulations.
We can therefore use the model to understand the cause of the complicated dependence of the binary eccentricity
on the deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$.
\autoref{fig:model_orbits} shows sets of orbits computed with the model for two different potential shapes,
with the parameters otherwise as in the model that matches the $e_0=0.90$ simulation results.
In the $e_\mathrm{s}=0.9$ case the shape of the orbit after the initial scattering depends strongly on the deflection angle,
as the asymmetric potential causes torque on the SMBHs that are not moving along the main axes of the potential.
On the other hand, in the more symmetric potential with $e_\mathrm{s}=0.2$,
The orbit shape is not very sensitive to the deflection angle due to the symmetry of the system,
and the binary always reaches extremely high eccentricities.


% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

We show in \autoref{sec:results} that variation in eccentricity $e_\mathrm{h}$ for a given system configuration is tightly correlated with the variation in the deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$, independent of the simulation mass resolution.
The inclusion of the toy model allows us to investigate the relationship between $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ and $e_\mathrm{h}$ in the infinite-mass resolution limit, around which the quantities measured from the simulation demonstrate minimal scatter. 
As shown by the simulation points and the marginal kernel density estimates (KDEs) of \autoref{fig:theta_e}, the variation in eccentricity can span almost the full domain space of $[0,1]$.
Galaxy mergers which have a more radial initial orbit $e_0$ are expected to demonstrate increased variance in eccentricity \citep{gualandris2022} \drafting{other refs needed here}.
However, as the majority of major galaxy mergers in the real Universe are expected to be radial \citep[e.g.][]{khochfar2006}, understanding if the origin of the eccentricity scatter is a numerical or a physical effect is of paramount importance, and will have direct implications for the predictions of SMBH merger rates by ongoing and future GW detection missions. 
We thus turn our discussion to the cause of variation in the impact parameter $b$ (and hence by \autoref{eq:theta}, $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$) first in simulations, and then in reality, as a predictor of the eccentricity variance. 
\drafting{Mention that we see qualitatively similar results for more realistic density profiles (e.g. the Hernquist runs).}

In numerical simulations with a discretised phase space, the two primary causes of variation in $b$ are initial particle sampling variation in the merger IC and Brownian motion of the SMBH binary \citep{merritt2001}, both of which have been shown to be more pronounced in lower mass resolution simulations compared to higher mass resolution simulations. 
By allowing the SMBH binary to wander further from its expected location in phase space, a wider range of impact parameters, and thus deflection angles, may be sampled.
This consequently maps to a different sampling of the eccentricity space, however due to the non-linear mapping (as shown in \autoref{fig:theta_e}), the eccentricity domain space sampled can vary between $\sigma_e \sim 0.01$ to $\sigma_e>0.1$, for the shown system configurations.
Different systems, with different galaxy density profiles or merger orbits, may have an even more pronounced value of $\sigma_e$.

Conversely, in the real universe, variation in the impact parameter of a similar magnitude to the presented simulations but as a consequence of different processes is expected due to the lack of system reproducibility.
As with many physical systems, random variations in the system state demand the use of statistics to ascertain a most probable configuration or outcome. 
Work by \citet{batcheldor2010} has suggested that the SMBH in M87 may be displaced from the galactic photo-centre by $\sim7\,\mathrm{pc}$ due to jet acceleration or gravitational recoil kicks. 
Assuming these processes are at play in other galaxies (particularly elliptical galaxies constructed through major mergers \citep{naab2006}), deviations of a few parsecs of the SMBH from the host galaxy photo-centre are expected and would influence the impact parameter two merging SMBHs would experience.

The results presented in this work are significant in constraining observational quantities that are correlated with binary eccentricity: most notably SMBH binary merger timescale. 
As the relevant scales of the impact parameter that lead to the deflection angle are typically of the order of a few parsecs, and are thus generally unresolvable in gravitationally-softened simulations, numerical simulations sample instead a non-deterministic distribution of potential impact parameters.
Building on from work by \citet{portegieszwart2018}, microscopic perturbations can grow to large scale, observable effects in a gravitational system over relatively short timescales, suggesting that even at physical mass resolution, chaotic dynamics still lead to a non-deterministic sampling of the impact parameter domain. 
From \autoref{fig:theta_e}, different initial orbital geometries also influence the deflection-angle domain space sampled, with not all merger geometries necessarily able to sample the full eccentricity domain (neglecting minor scatter in $e_\mathrm{h}$ due to sampling variation compared to the analytical prediction).
Importantly however, the sampling variation in $e_\mathrm{h}$ by the numerical simulations are largely independent of mass resolution, indicating that even at moderate mass resolutions of $M_\bullet/m_\star \sim 10^3$, the eccentricity distribution can be reliably sampled. 

Finally, we discuss the caveats of our conclusions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The systems we test in this work are exceptionally idealistic: spherical stellar bulges without dark matter (DM) on a merger orbit with very small initial separation. 
We do not however expect the conclusions concerning the $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$--$e_\mathrm{h}$ mapping to be significantly impacted by expanding our models to more realistic gravitational systems, as DM acts to provide a dynamical friction force over separation scales much larger than that of the impact parameter. 
Qualitatively, the scatter in eccentricity presented in this work is consistent with the eccentricity scatter in simulations including DM. 
\item The mergers presented in this work are all of equal mass galaxies, leading to very dramatic deformations of the potential that deviate from spherical symmetry. 
In the instance of minor mergers where the galaxy merger remnant is not as triaxial as the major merger case \citep{khan2012}, we do not expect to see as sensitive dependence of eccentricity on deflection angle compared to the major merger case (refer to \autoref{fig:model_orbits}).
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, we have shown the importance of the deflection angle $\theta_\mathrm{defl}$ on the resulting hard binary eccentricity $e_\mathrm{h}$. 
By using a resolution-free toy model of the SMBH scattering process, we demonstrate that uncertainty in SMBH binary eccentricity is not caused solely by discretisation effects in galaxy merger simulations.
The results presented here justify extending the investigation to more realistic galaxy merger scenarios, to quantify the expected range of hard binary eccentricities critical for merger timescale predictions for future gravitational wave observation missions.
