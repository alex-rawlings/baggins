    INTERPRETATIONS
    \begin{itemize}
        \item major mergers: orbit does not influence remnant properties
        \item minor mergers: orbit affects $R_\mathrm{e}$, $n$ --> observations of ETGs with high $n$ more likely to have formed through low eccentricity minor merger events?
    \end{itemize}
