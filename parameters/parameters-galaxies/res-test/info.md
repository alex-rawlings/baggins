# Resolution Tests (Isolated)

This directory contains the parameter files for the isolated initial conditions
at different particle mass resolutions to be used in setting up mass resolution
testing. The fiducial mass resolutions are:

- Stellar particles: $1.0\times10^{5}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$
- DM particles: $3.7\times10^{7}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$

There are four reduced mass resolutions that are tested, denoted by:

**xN**

where **N** is the amount the mass resolution is decreased by, or alternatively,
by how much the particle mass has increased. The tested mass resolutions are:

1. Decreased by a factor of 2 (x02)
2. Decreased by a factor of 5 (x05)
3. Decreased by a factor of 10 (x10)
4. Decreased by a factor of 20 (x20)

All other physical parameters of the galaxy ICs are maintained.
