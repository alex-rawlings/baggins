# Things yet to be implemented in the cm_functions package

* Inclusion of other spin models from Zlochower & Luosto  
* Handling of literature data other than the defaults. This would require
  tailored reading in of data (maybe include a new submodule for this?)  
* Other separation and pericentre distances for merger_setup.py  
* Implement package version check
* Script to set up simulation data directory
