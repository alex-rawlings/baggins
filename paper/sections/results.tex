Figures to do
\begin{itemize}
\item Example of forward-modelled semimajor axis and eccentricity
\item Example of forward-modelled density profile
\item Example of forward-modelled velocity dispersion profile
\end{itemize}
Table of galaxy properties,
and maybe another one of BH merger remnant properties.

    WHAT ARE THE MAIN OBSERVATIONS WE SEE and WHAT CONCLUSIONS CAN WE DRAW?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item stability of hardening rate -> semimajor axis can be robustly predicted
        \item wide variance of eccentricity -> N-body models offer no quantitative prediction on likelihood of merger, can only comment on what merger looks like \textit{IF} it happens
        \item variance in observables: trends between observable properties and what observers can actually make use of (don't have this yet), e.g. signatures of SMBH scouring in velocity profile?
    \end{enumerate}
