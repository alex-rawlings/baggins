# Collisionless Merger Sample #  

## What is this repository for?  
* Initialisation, analysis, and presentation of a large sample of collisionless merger simulations using the `KETJU` code developed by the Helsinki Theoretical Astrophyiscs Group  
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

## How do I get set up?  
1. Add the path to `./code/cm_functions` to the `PYTHONPATH` variable in your `~/.bashrc` profile to load the necessary functions as a normal module  

## Directory Organisation  
* all code (functions, scripts, classes, etc.) required to perform the simulation initialisations and analysis is located in `./code/`
* data (expected to be) from the output is saved in `./data/`, but is not uploaded to the BitBucket
* the paper(s) pertaining to this simulation set can be found in `./paper/`, with each paper section as a separate file in `./paper/sections/`
* parameter files for all simulations can be found in `./parameters/`. These parameter files are expected to be used in conjunction with the functions and scripts in `./code/`
