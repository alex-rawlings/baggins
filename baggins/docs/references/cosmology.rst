cosmology package
=================

Whilst BAGGInS has been primarily designed for gas-free non-cosmological simulations, sometimes we need to calculate cosmological quantities of interest.
An example would be the angular scale in setting an instrument's resolution for a given redshift.

All methods and functions are called using::

   baggins.cosmology.XXX

where `XXX` is the method name.
