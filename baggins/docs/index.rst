Documentation for BAGGInS
========================================

The Bayesian Analysis of Galaxy-Galaxy Interactions in Simulations (BAGGInS) tool is designed to facilitate a Bayesian-orientated approach to analysing galaxy merger simulations run with the Ketju extension of Gadget.

In addition to analysis of simulations, tools to set up different mergers, as well as handy plotting routines and utility functions, are included.

The tool has been primarily designed for isolated gas-free simulations, however a plan to extend the capability to work with isolated hydro-simulations, is in the works.
